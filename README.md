# thousands-spheres

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-r3f-app`](https://github.com/utsuboco/create-r3f-app)

A R3F version of https://github.com/Anemolo/100k-objects-with-Instanced-Geometries demo.

Using Instanced geometries and shaders to render up to 100K spheres with 60fps (at least in my local :grinning:).
